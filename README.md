# Nastran Input Writer
My implementation of a Nastran input file writer.

I made this before discovering pyNastran (and for educational purposes, maybe), I highly recomend the use o pyNastran.
But this can be useful if you are implementing some other code that has the input standard the same of Nanstran.
